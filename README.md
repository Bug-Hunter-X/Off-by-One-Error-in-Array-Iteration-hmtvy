# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array.  The error occurs in the `main` method of `MyClass.java`. The for loop attempts to access an index beyond the bounds of the array, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution corrects this error by adjusting the loop condition.
